# 🌐 TDBuilder

**TDBuilder** is a graphical tool designed to simplify the creation, editing, and visualization of Thing Descriptions (TDs) for cyber-physical systems, following the [W3C Web of Things (WoT)](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) standard.

This tool reduces the learning curve for working with TDs by enabling users to interact intuitively with templates through a visual interface. By incorporating usability principles and enhancing information visibility, TDBuilder improves the user experience and encourages wider adoption of WoT technologies.
